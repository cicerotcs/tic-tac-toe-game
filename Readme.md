## How the game works

1. The user launches the tic-tac-toe game on their device.
2. The game then presents the user with a empty tic-tac-toe board and a menu screen that allows them to choose between playing against the computer or another player.
3. The game randomly determine who goes first. The game then waits for the player's first move.
4. The player who goes first selects a square to place their marker (either an X or O).
5. If playing against the computer, the game displays the computer's move on the board and waits for the player's next move.
6. If playing against another player, the game switches to the next player and waits for their move.
7. The game continues until either a player wins or the board is completely filled.
8. If a player wins, the game displays a message declaring that player as the winner, update it's score and reset the game.
9. If the board is completely filled with no winner, the game displays a message declaring the game a tie and reset the game.
